        make a
        transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
        for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
        the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

        gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable

      <p class="opacity-70 w-[240px] lg:w-full lg:leading-[18px]">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
        structure from
        professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint.
        They
        were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve
        often
        referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as
        a
        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
